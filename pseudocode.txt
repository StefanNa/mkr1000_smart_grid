2. read ADC from "oscilloscope"
	sample rate 10k

3. 	read ADC from "oscilloscope"
	save in array
	read again
	compare

4. add low pass filter 
	cut off 50 Hz

5. experiment with cutoff 10-100Hz

6. up sample rate to 20k

7. zero crossing detection

8. inrerpolate zero crossing?

9. check if interrupt is constant (pre setup and then in the lab)

10. connect LED to threshholds (+potentiometer)

11. interface

12.

apply low pass filter
